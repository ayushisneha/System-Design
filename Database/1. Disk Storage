Data Storage Access Patterns:
	a. Sequential
	b. Random
Sequential writes doesn't always mean sequential reads - but offers better locality of reference from caching perspective.

B+ Trees and LSM Tree are the two basic data structures when we talk about building blocks of databases.

B+ Trees are used when we need less search and insertion time.
LSM Trees are used for write-intensive databases with less reads.

LSM-Tree:  Log-Structured Merge Tree

LSM Trees is an immutable disk resident data structure, optimized for sequential writes while maintaining acceptable read performance.
LSM Trees are the underlying data structure for many highly scalable NOSQL distributed key value type databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra,etc.
