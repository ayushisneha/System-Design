Redundancy: duplication of critical components (web server, database server, etc) to increase reliability and availability, by 
avoiding single point of failure.

a. Passive Redundancy - The redundant component sits idle until there's a failover, and then it takes the charge.
In case of failure, the system must ensure the state of redundant component is fresh, thus its the job of primary component to
continuously inform the standby components to update their state.
Periodically forcing switchover can ensure that the redundant component will work fine in case of failure of primary component.
Sometimes passive redundancy may not provide instant recovery as there can be delay in realising failure and switching. So it 
may require other fault tolerant techniques like active monitoriing, regular testing, and fault detection mechanisms.
Can be useful when:
	- scalability is not prime concern
	- downtown or failure can have significant consequences
	- failover process requires manual intervention.

b. Active Redundancy
Multiple identical components works simultaneously, sharing load and executing tasks concurrently. 
Used when:
	- high availability is required
	- traffic is high
	- rapid recovery is required in event of failure
