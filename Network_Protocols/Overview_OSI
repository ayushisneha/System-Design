Overview

The 7 OSI Layer: 
1. Application - Provides services & protocols to applications to exchange data. HTTP, SMTP, FTP
2. Presentation - encryption and decryption of data
3. Session - manages communication session between applications.
4. Transport - ensures reliable and efficient data transfer by breaking them into packets. TCP, UDP
5. Network - determines best path for data transmission across networks by routing algorithms and IP addressing. IP
6. Data Link - 
7. Physical 


Internet Protocol -
Network layer protocol. 
IP Packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet. It consists of IP header(IP address, size of packet, protocol, etc.)
and the data (payload). 

TCP-
TCP is the transport layer protocol, built on top of IP.
The data to be transmitted can be very large, and a single IP Packet maynot be sufficient, and it may require to break the data into
multiple packets. TCP ensures successful transmission of all the packets, error-checks and request the missing packets again, and re-assemble 
the packets in-order.

UDP-
UDP is also the transport layer protocol, built on top of IP. It however doesn't provide reliable data transfer. The hand-shaking and
other checksums in TCP increases latency and thus is not very efficient where speed is required and some loss is bearable. In such scenarios
like video calling, streaming, etc, UDP is used.

HTTP-
HTTP is a Application layer protocol, built on top of TCP. It provides abstraction to developers to focus on application rather than details
of TCP/IP.
